# Photo Portfolio - Gatsby + Contentful + Netlify

[See it in action](https://jpvalery.photo)

## Overview

Codebase for [https://jpvalery.photo](https://jpvalery.photo) my photography portfolio.
Current iteration is built using Contentful, Netlify, and Gatsby V2; and was launched in January 2019. Based on [@iammatthias/.com](https://github.com/iammatthias/.com)

This site makes heavy use of the [`gatsby-image`](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) plugin, pulling optimized fluid assets from Contentful.

### Features

- Netlify integration
- Styled components
- Progressive Web app
- Offline Support
- RSS Feed

##### Notes

> Code can be used as a reference for other Gatsby projects, but this repo will not work out-of-the-box without replicating the Contentful data structure. If you would like to quickly bootstrap a Gatsby + Contentful + Netlify project, I recommend checking out the fantastic [GCN](https://github.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-starter-gcn) starter.

> This repo uses Yarn, over NPM.
